    <p class="bio1"><span class="featured-artist">Ruth Armitage — Ruth Armitage Studios</span><br>My current series, Down on the Farm, deals with my connection to the land, specifically the family farm. I paint abstracted aerial views of the fields and forests with an emphasis on color, shape and mark making.  Rich, vibrant color embellished by narrative and symbolic pencil and brush marks tells the stories of my connection to the land that has been home to my family.</p>

    <p class="bio2"><span class="featured-artist">Thomas Caccamo — Open Portland Studios</span><br>I build collages in clay. My procedures are similar to artists who cut shapes out of paper then reassemble the pieces onto a background. I use cut-outs from slabs of rolled white clay instead of paper. The pieces are shaped, finely sanded, fired and then assembled with epoxy. The ultra-smooth layers give dimension to the works and emphasize line and shadow. The starkness of the unglazed white clay lets you see the shapes and lines they create without distraction.  Assembly of the ceramic components for the bas-relief is post firing for technical and aesthetic reasons.</p>
